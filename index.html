    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2020, Storm Dynamics was born from a mission to bring greater efficiency and innovation to the field of meteorology. Our products are designed to empower emergency managers, meteorologists, scientists, and the general public with tools that provide deeper insight into weather phenomena and enable more informed, timely decisions.</p>

    <p>We offer a wide array of weather data products—from traditional NEXRAD base products to cutting-edge solutions for tornado detection and tracking, GOES satellite imagery, lightning analysis, flood and hurricane monitoring, wind and atmospheric conditions, and NASA remote sensing datasets.</p>
      
    <p>At Storm Dynamics, our goal is to make everyone weather aware. We streamline the forecasting process by reducing the friction involved in accessing critical data—eliminating the need for multiple platforms or excessive searching to get the right information fast.</p>
      
    <p>Whether you're visualizing weather patterns or integrating live data into your operations, Storm Dynamics provides powerful data and visualization services to help you stay ahead of the storm.</p>
